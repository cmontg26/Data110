### Presenter: Candace Montgomery
**Course**: DATA 110

```
Telling Stories Through Data: A Visual Journey at the National Museum of African American History: This presentation's main
objective is to build data visualization literacy in a museum setting. I visited the National Museum of African American
History and Culture and after collecting over 10 images of visualizations that told stories using data, I narrowed it
down to 4 data visualizations. These select images detail how historically data and art have long worked hand in hand to
tell our greatest American stories.

# Brief History
Date of Visit: October 10, 2025
### The National Museum of African American History and Culture
1400 Constitution Ave, NW, Washington, DC 20560

>The National Museum of African American History and Culture (NMAAHC), colloquially known as the Blackstonian, is a Smithsonian Institution museum 
located on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., in the United States. It was established in 2003 and opened its permanent home in 2016.
Early efforts to establish a federally owned museum featuring African-American history and culture can be traced to 1915 but did not get 
a legislative push until 1988. Finally in 2003, a museum was authorized. A site was selected in 2006, and a design submitted by Freelon Group/Adjaye 
Associates/Davis Brody Bond in 2009. Construction began in 2012 and the museum completed in 2016.

# Reflections

I was surprised to learn about W.E.B. Dubois’ exhibit at the 1900 Paris World Exposition and how his very early works contributed to the field of modern-day data science.

I have a renewed respect for the ways data can be used to tell stories, historical ones and things yet to come, how data can be used to paint a picture of an era or show the relationship between then and now (points in time) or here and there (locations).

One design lesson I will carry forward is understanding how color and shapes can command the audience’s attention or serve as a distraction.
