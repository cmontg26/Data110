The National Museum of African American History and Culture (NMAAHC), colloquially known as the Blackstonian, is a Smithsonian Institution museum 
located on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., in the United States. It was established in 2003 and opened its permanent home in 2016.
Early efforts to establish a federally owned museum featuring African-American history and culture can be traced to 1915 but did not get 
a legislative push until 1988. Finally in 2003, a museum was authorized. A site was selected in 2006, and a design submitted by Freelon Group/Adjaye 
Associates/Davis Brody Bond in 2009. Construction began in 2012 and the museum completed in 2016.
